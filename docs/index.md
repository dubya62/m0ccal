# Welcome M0ccal
* The Modular, 0-Cost, C Abstraction Language.
* The purpose of this programming language is to allow low level control that can be abstracted away using objects.

## Core Ideas
* Arbitrary precision Integers and Floats builtin
* Arbitrary length arrays and Dictionaries (Associative Arrays) builtin
* No runtime errors are possible - no try, except/catch
* Strong pattern matching support
* Automatic Garbage Collection
* Verbose (if specified) error messages
* Guarantees and Assumptions at compile-time to remove logical errors
* Lax syntax
    * Mix and match python style colon and whitespace with C style braces
