    Inheritance is allowed

Helpful Error Message Update:
    Give extremely descriptive error messages and help on errors

Pattern matching update:
    Add the pattern matching block

Constraint/Assumption update:
    Trace the value of variables throughout the program and throw constraint errors

Memory optimization update:
    Use custom malloc and free and statically determine lifetime of variables

Multithreading update:
    Allow using multiple threads while keeping constraints, assumptions, and memory all safe
