Beta:
    Basic syntax and transpilation to C
    No constraints, assumptions, special @ directives
    No heavy optimization
    Just use malloc and no frees for memory management right now
    Inheritance is allowed

FIXME: imported programs can access variables in the main program

Package Manager update:
    Make an easy way to install packages and compile them into the program

Create Core Library:
    AssociativeArray
    DynamicArray
    Array
    String
    Int
    Float

Helpful Error Message update:
    Give extremely descriptive error messages and help on errors

Pattern matching update:
    Add the pattern matching block

Constraint/Assumption update:
    Trace the value of variables throughout the program and throw constraint errors

Memory optimization update:
    Use custom malloc and free and statically determine lifetime of variables

Multithreading update:
    Allow using multiple threads while keeping constraints, assumptions, and memory all safe
